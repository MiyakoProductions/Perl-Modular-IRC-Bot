This is an IRC Bot written perl that uses a modular structure. Allowing for commands and plugins to be written in real time without the need to restart the script itself.

Included here are a base template (modular.pl) and a more advanced (koyomi.pl), fully featured version that is multi-threaded with dozens of web api's, local api's for linux systems and fun commands and games.
Note: ALL API KEYS AND ADMIN INFO HAVE BEEN OMMITTED!
